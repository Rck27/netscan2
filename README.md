# netscan2
the continuation of the netscan project but for neighbourhood network

## why?
so, my internet access was in crysis, as more quota was  used, and because im using quota based internet, that will run out in less than a month, well that freaks me out.
so my neighborhood was having this network where everyone was connected by 'local provider' and im trying to scan them all out, each individual router that goes to this provider, and  i have one network opened for me, so i can connect to that network and began my scanning

## then what?
well, scanning things were easy enough, i have scanned the entire subnet within a day, and sort them based on the router  model, then i wanted to make things more interesting by:
  - scrapping their router webui and extract  the wifi password and possibly enable hidden network for me to use, still on progress though
  - map out where each router  were located, perhaps not possible
  - something else, idk, time will  tell
